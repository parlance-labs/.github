# 👋 Hey there! We're Parlance Labs

We're a group of AI engineers led by [Hamel Husain](https://hamel.dev) who help companies improve AI products with data-driven approaches. We're an engineer-only firm - no handwaiving or slide decks.

## What we're about

Here's what drives our approach:

- We establish [systematic AI evaluation](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/) that's specific to your product & domain (because how else will you know if your AI is doing anything useful?)
- We're data-obsessed and pragmatic. We teach you [processes that have worked](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/field-guide/) across more than 30 AI implementations.
- We've developed methods to make sure your AI can [provide business value and produce results](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/llm-judge/) you trust.
  
## We're the consultancy who wants you to "fire us"

Here's something different about us: **we don't want you to have a long-term dependency on us**. We're not here to pitch you on new models, frameworks, or expensive infrastructure. We *are* here to teach you methods to experiment faster and systematically improve your systems, regardless of your domain or use-case.

We don't chase recurring revenue or sell maintenance contracts - we think that creates perverse incentives.  Instead, we work alongside your team, transfer knowledge, and build capabilities so that when we leave, you have:

- The skills to evaluate your AI systems.
- Processes for continuous improvement.
- Systems that save you time and resources by objectively surfacing the highest impact issues.
- The ability to select the best tools, vendors and frameworks while minimizing complexity.
- Independence from consultants (including us!).
