# 👋 Hey there! We're Parlance Labs

We're a group of AI engineers led by [Hamel Husain](https://hamel.dev) who help companies figure out if their AI is actually working (spoiler: often it's not) and how to make it better.

## What we're all about

Here's what drives our approach:

- We build systems for [systematic AI evaluation](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/) (because how else will you know if your AI is doing anything useful?)
- We're data-obsessed and pragmatic. We teach you [processes that have worked](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/field-guide/) more than 30 AI implementations.
- We've developed methods to make sure your AI can [provide business value and produce results you can trust](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/llm-judge/).
  
## We’re the consultancy who wants you to "fire us”

Here's something different about us: **we don't want you to have a long-term dependency on us**. We’re not here to pitch you on new models, frameworks, or expensive infrastructure. We *are* here to teach you methods to experiment faster and systematically improve your systems, regardless of your domain or use-case.

We don't chase recurring revenue or sell maintenance contracts - we think that creates perverse incentives.  Instead, we work alongside your team, transfer knowledge, and build capabilities so that when we leave, you have:
- The skills to evaluate your AI systems
- Processes for continuous improvement
- Independence from consultants (including us!)
